# Open Source Web Analytics (Functional)
This post provides an overview of open source web analytics tools and tries to differentiate them from each other.

## Overview
The table below displays the different open source web analytics tools. The maturity scores are taken from an earlier blog post that is dedicated to reviewing the maturity of a set of OSWA tools.  

| Platform                                                      | [Maturity score](/oswa_comparison) |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| [Matomo](https://Matomo.org)                                  | 100                                |
| [Open Web Analytics](http://www.openwebanalytics.com/)        | 76                                 |
| [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee)                 | 58                                 |
| [fathom](https://usefathom.com/)                              | 63                                 |
| [frequency](https://github.com/frequencyanalytics/frequency)  | 26                                 |
| [trackingco.de](https://github.com/fiatjaf/trackingco.de)     | 7                                  |
| [picostats](https://github.com/picostats/picostats)           | 0                                  |
| [GoAccess](https://goaccess.io/)                              | 51                                 |
| [Visitors](http://www.hping.org/visitors/)                    | 11                                 |
| [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack)         | 100                                |
| [Plausible](https://plausible.io)                             | 50                                 |

## Excluded 
All products with a maturity score below 50 are excluded. Products with a score below or with 50 are:
* [trackingco.de](https://github.com/fiatjaf/trackingco.de) - Score: 7
* [picostats](https://github.com/picostats/picostats) - Score: 0
* [Visitors](http://www.hping.org/visitors/) - Score : 11
* [Plausible](https://plausible.io) - Score: 50

### Log analytics
We will not be taking into account log analytics tools as alternatives for web analytics tools. Log analytics tools provide different functionalities for a different user group. Mainly developers willing to gain insight in server performance rather than the marketing and communication department interested in KPIs. 

We saw in the earlier tracking techniques post that log analytics tools also cannot give full insight into website usage. Another argument for excluding log analytics tools is the lack of pre-defined statistics and dashboards provided by web analytics tools. Constructing these from the ground up will require technical knowledge which not all target users possess.

## Differentiation of products
A number of points to base the differentiation of the products on are listed below. 

| Requirement                                             | Ideal situation                              |

**Note:** not all tools gave a clear indication of each high level requirement. Question marks are filled where the answer is not sure or not found.

## Log analytics tools
As mentioned above log analytics tools were excluded from the functional comparison above. We can however compare the ELK stack to GoAccess. Where the main difference is that GoAccess provides a solution that interprets the log data based on the most common log formats. And provides features to gain insight in the data. While using the ELK stack those measures have to be configured and defined manually.
